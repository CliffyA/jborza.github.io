## Introduction

I don't like online ads too much. The easy option on a computer is to use an adblocker, but on some devices you are out of options (smart TV, or mobile games with in-game ads).
I have started using [Pi-hole](https://pi-hole.net) about 2 months ago on my home network to block ads and tracking across the entire home network, on all devices. 
Pi-hole is a self-titled black hole for internet advertising, as it acts as a DNS server and blocks requests on a name resolution lavel, based on a blacklist.

## Pi-hole on the go

I'd like to use Pi-hole on my phone also outside my home Wi-Fi. As I happen to host my services in the Azure public cloud, I decided to set up a small Ubuntu server instance and install Pi-hole on it.
